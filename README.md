## 📊 Strategies Covered

1. **Iron Butterfly**  
   High premium, but requires the price to stay close to the center strike.

2. **Bull Call Spread**  
   Directional strategy that performs well in moderately bullish markets.

3. **Put Butterfly**  
   Low cost and good reward if the asset stays near the strike price.

## ✅ Recommendation

Based on the trade-off between reward, risk, and cost:
> If the market is expected to be **stable or slightly bullish**, the **Bull Call Spread** provides the best risk-adjusted return with moderate exposure and a defined profit/loss structure.
